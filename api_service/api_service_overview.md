# API service overview
API Service is a unified external interface service tool provided by EnOS™ System. The unified public API service of the EnOS™ System provided by API Service can be used for developers to add, delete, modify and check relevant resources (including device assets, personnel, applications and permissions) stored in the EnOS™ System. API Service also provides complete API hosting service to help developers open services based on EnOS™ to partners in the form of APIs.

## API management
API management provides complete API hosting services for EnOS™ developers and help developed open APP/Service which is developed based on EnOS™ to partners and external developers in the form of APIs. Users can open their data or services easily, quickly, at low cost and with low risk.
API management provides unified invocation in a restful manner to interface with any system of proxy developers.
- API management provides a user-friendly control interface for developers to intuitively manage APIs (including API definitions, tests, releases / off-line, etc.) and monitor service invocation to view performance indicators and related information, data delays, and error rates of API invocation.
- API management provides a series of plug-ins commonly used for interfaces, such as security and flow control, and provides functions such as attack prevention, APP authentication, permission management, traffic control, etc. Users can quickly and quickly enable or disable them.
- API management also allows developers to run multiple versions of the same API at the same time, so that they can quickly iterate, test and release new versions and reduce day-to-day maintenance costs.
